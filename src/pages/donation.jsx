                    SHS is a non-profit voluntary organization. The building was
                    originally built in 1945 and used by various owners. In 1987
                    it was purchased by SHS, renovated, and financed partly by
                    individual donors and partly by a government grant. A large
                    number of individuals made their invaluable contribution in
                    the form of cash, kind, expertise, time and goodwill. Regular
                    expenses consist of hydro (electricity), gas, water,
                    telephone, property insurance charges, cleaning, consumables,
                    and maintenance. The routine operation and maintenance is
                    financed by membership subscriptions, Puja offerings at
                    various occasions, regular donations in cash & kind,
                    occasional rental income, and specially solicited donations.
                    The money for major capital projects comes mostly from
                    generous donations by several members.

                    Any SHS member, or another organization represented by an SHS
                    member, can rent the Mandir for a day with a pre-determined
                    nominal payment, and per established rules & guidelines. The
                    amount covers the direct immediate Mandir expenses, and the
                    remainder goes towards funds for long-term Mandir
                    expenditures. A copy of the latest Rental Agreement must be
                    obtained by the Renter from the SHS President or designate,
                    reviewed, discussed, signed and returned alongwith the
                    applicable rental & deposit amount cheques, and pre-approved
                    by the Board before being effective.
