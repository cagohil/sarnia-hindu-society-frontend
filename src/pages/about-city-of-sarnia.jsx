                  Sarnia is a city in Lambton County, Ontario, Canada. It had a
                  2021 population of 72,047,[5] and is the largest city on Lake
                  Huron. Sarnia is located on the eastern bank of the junction
                  between the Upper and Lower Great Lakes where Lake Huron flows
                  into the St. Clair River in the Southwestern Ontario region,
                  which forms the Canadaâ€“United States border, directly across
                  from Port Huron, Michigan. The complex of refining and
                  chemical companies is called Chemical Valley and located south
                  of downtown Sarnia.[14] In 2011 the city had the highest level
                  of particulates air pollution of any Canadian city, but it has
                  since dropped to rank 30th in this hazard.[15] About 60
                  percent of the particulate matter comes from industries and
                  polluters in the neighbouring United States.[16] Lake Huron is
                  cooler than the air in summer and warmer than the air in
                  winter; therefore, it moderates Sarnia's humid continental
                  climate, making temperature extremes of hot and cold less
                  evident.[4] In the winter, Sarnia occasionally experiences
                  lake-effect snow from Arctic air blowing across the warmer
                  waters of Lake Huron and condensing to form snow squalls over
                  land.[17]
