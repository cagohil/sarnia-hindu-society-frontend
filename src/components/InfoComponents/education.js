                  Many children’s programs were initiated in the past several
                  years. These are continuing at present with further
                  enhancements. Most of them are very popular in the community
                  with children and their parents alike. These are summarized
                  below.

                    <strong>Hindi Classes:</strong>
                  </div>
                  Hindi Classes were started in Sarnia in 2002, at the
                  initiative of Mrs. Chandrika Patel, the then Director of
                  Immigrant & Newcomer Settlement Services, and long time & life
                  member of SHS. These are funded by the Government of Canada
                  through Department of Citizenship & Immigration. The classes
                  are held in the evening at YMCA Learning & Career Centre, 660
                  Oakdale Ave, Sarnia, under the supervision of Lambton Kent
                  District School Board. Kids from 4-1/2 years of age up to
                  Grade 8 are eligible to attend. The instructor is Usha Bansal.
                  We teach Hindi speaking, writing, reading & comprehension in a
                  graduated progressive way. We also do rehearsal of Bhajans &
                  speeches, which are then presented by the kids in the Mandir
                  on regular Sunday congregations and other occasions. The
                  classes are held on Thursdays from 6:00 pm to 8:30 pm.
